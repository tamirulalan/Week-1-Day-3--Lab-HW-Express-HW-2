# Week-1-Day-3--Lab-HW-Express-HW-2
Second Express Homework
Practice the Basics of Express

Purpose From Curriculum Development Team: This HW is the second hw where we try to push learners out of their comfort zone and have them put together their new knowledge of express and there problem solving muscles that they learned in Pre-Work and Mod 1. Learners will need to think about how to solve each problem conceptually and then use the knowledge they learned the last 3 days to solve the problems. This lab purposely uses industry terminology to describe instructions which may prompt learners to ask clarifying questions or to google meanings. That's ok and expected.
